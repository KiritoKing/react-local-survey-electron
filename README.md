# React-Electron Local Survey System

*React-Electron Local Survey System* is a open source survey management application using **MIT** license.

This application uses React for UI building and electron for backend API to interact with local file system. **JSON**s are used to store and convey surveys and results.

Considering basic work are already done by boilerplates and libraries, my work mainly focus on the **electron API** needed and **survey editing** utils which is not provided in *SurveyJS* lib.

If you have any problems, just commit a new [Issue](https://github.com/KiritoKing/react-local-survey-electron/issues/new/choose) in Github, and I'll check it soon.
